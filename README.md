# P5.5
## p5.5.js is an addon for the p5.js library. It is a combination of a UI with panning and zooming and more nice things. The UI tweaks are an implementation of the [lil-gui.js](https://lil-gui.georgealways.com/) library. The hotkeys are made possible by using the [tinykeys.js](https://jamiebuilds.github.io/tinykeys/) library.
